# Part 6: Formatting
# 1. Use f-string to print:
# "My name is Alice and I am 20 years old."
name  = "Alice"
age = 20
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# Use .format() to print:
# "Temperature today is 30°C"
temperature = 30
print("Temperature today is {}°C".format(temperature))
