#Level 1 â€“ Basics (Warm-Up)
# Store your age in a variable and print it.
# Store the price of an item (float) and print it.
# Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers.
# Divide two integers and show:
# Normal division ( / )
# Floor division ( // )
# Modulus ( % )
# Multiply a float by an integer and print the result.
# Use type() to check the data type of each result
