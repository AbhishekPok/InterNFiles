#concating is easily done using + operator
word1 = "Python"
word2 = " is awesome."
print(word1 + word2)  # Output: Python is awesome.
#concatenating is also possible using f-strings which is more industry standard nowadays.
#for example:
usingformat = f"{word1}{word2}"
print(usingformat)  # Output: Python is awesome.
